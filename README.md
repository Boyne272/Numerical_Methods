# Numerical_Methods

A collection of numerical methods code I have gathered through course assignment in my degrees. Mostly Implemented in python.

## Repository Structure

- FD_FEM_methods - A small collection of numerical integrators (e.g. RK2) and practice of solving the advection diffusion equation in either steady or time varying states. All methods and there solutions are explained by an accompanying notebook.

- Interpolation - Holds a large collection of numerical excersises including interpolation, LU decomposition (and other matrix methods), fast-fourier transforms, investigation of pseudo random numbers and machine precision. These are all given as flexable python functions.

- Method_of_Manufactured_Solutions - Contains an example notebook whereby the method of manufactured solutions is used to verify a numerical solver for the advection diffusion problem. There is also a notebook exploring the use of sympy which is very useful for creating a manufactured solution.

- Numerical_Integration - Contains monte carlo and newton coats methods for integration of a functions. The vegas (adaptive monte carlo method) has also been implemented and extensivly investigated to show good performance on high dimensional functions.
