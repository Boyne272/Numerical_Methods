Code is stored entirely in funcions from the following moduals:

import functions as fun
import Vegas_final as vg
import simpsons_trapezium_final as st
import transformation_final as tr

All funcitons written are documented as to how they function, what they requier and what they return.

importing these and then running the following commands repoduces all data in report:
(can just copy and past in but will take a few mins and produce many graphs)

st.solve_ts() # solve simpsons trapezium for wavefunction (produces 2 plots)

st.val_ts(plot = False) # validate simpsons trapezium for three functions
# plot = True to reproduce 6 plots

# solve monte carlo importance sampling for uniform pdf to rel accuracy 1e-6 (produces 2 plots)
tr.solve_tran(pdf = fun.uni_pdf, trans=fun.trans_uni, e = 1e-6)

# solve monte carlo importance sampling for linear pdf to rel accuracy 1e-6 (produces 2 plots)
tr.solve_tran(e=1e-6)

# validate monte carlo importance sampling via tranfomration method
tr.val_tran(plot = False)
# plot = True to reproduce 6 plots

tr.plot_times() # plot the iterations taken with relative accuracy

# solve Vegas for relative accuracy of 1e-4 (produces 2 plots)
vg.solve_veg(e = 1e-4)

# validate Vegas on lower than previous relative accuracies for reasonable run times
vg.val_veg(plot = False)
# plot = True to reproduce 6 plots
