## Repository Structure
- sections/ contains the notebooks we were given for this coursework
- questions/ hold work in progress versions of my solutions, should not need to see
- data/ hold the airfoils, reference data, shape and pictures used in the technical report
- panel_method_derivatives.py and potential_flow.py are python files given to us for this project
- notebook_functions.py holds unedited versions of the functions and classes contained in the notebooks given (found in sections/). This is to import in the technical report so as to prevent it being excessively long.
- Technical Report has at its end a short use manual for the airfoil optimisation routines developed here

## Notes to the examiner
The Technical Report has every cell already run and from start to finish has a very significant runtime (est. ~2hr). Despite my best plans, I was working till the deadline, hence did not have a chance to re-run the whole notebook start to finish. I am fairly confident it is bug-free as I didn't change any cells after I executed them, however, be cautious of the odd running order of the cells.

Hope my project isn't too much of a pain to mark and thanks :)
